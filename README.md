# NotepadClone
A very simple Windows Notepad clone. Not to be a 1-to-1 replica, but to have the same basic look and functionality of Windows Notepad in C# WinForms. This project was just for fun and not a serious program to be used.

# Known issues
-Memory increases as text is appended in Richtextbox

-When clicking 'X' then clicking 'Close', the dialog box displays again

-Printing and page setup functionality not implemented

-Using control+scroll wheel changes text size but percentage does not change with it

-Proper encoding not added
